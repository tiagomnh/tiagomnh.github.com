# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Tiago Henriques, a software engineer living in Coimbra, Portugal. Since 2013 I've been at [WIT Software](https://www.wit-software.com/) working on some cool iOS apps for some of the world's largest telcos. I also try to do some [open source goodness](https://github.com/tiagomnh) in my spare time.

When I'm not writing code, I'm usually travelling, [taking photos](http://instagram.com/tiagomnh), watching movies or singing in the shower.

Want to get in touch? Shoot me a [tweet](http://twitter.com/tiagomnh) or an [email](mailto:tiagomnh@gmail.com).
